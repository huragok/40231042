Implementation of Modified Continuously Variable Slope Delta Codec on DSP

This is part of the course project "Network Voice Transmission Based on Continuously Variable Slope Delta Codec" for 40231042 Digital Signal Processing Lab in Tsinghua University, 2011 Winter, by Ge Zhang, Wenhao Wu and Mengdi Wang. 

"huragok" was in charge of implementing the modified CVSD codec on EBF-533 test board with assembly language (*.asm) and it worked perfectly on the DSP. However, due to some frame length problem, the codec and the network communication module failed to work together.

Here I presented the matlab and assembly program as well as the report for the codec design. Unfortunately, though, the report and the comments in the program are not in English.
